            Your heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem goes here.

            This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.  First, try to come
            up with an admissible heuristic; almost all admissible heuristics will be
            consistent as well.

            If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse uniform cost search finds,
            your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!  On the
            other hand, inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal
            solutions, so be careful.

            The state is a tuple ( pacmanPosition, foodGrid ) where foodGrid is a Grid
            (see game.py) of either True or False. You can call foodGrid.asList() to get
            a list of food coordinates instead.

            If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the
            problem.  For example, problem.walls gives you a Grid of where the walls
            are.

            If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the
            heuristic, there is a dictionary called problem.heuristicInfo that you can
            use. For example, if you only want to count the walls once and store that
            value, try: problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount'] = problem.walls.count()
            Subsequent calls to this heuristic can access

            """
            Your heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem goes here.

            This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.  First, try to come
            up with an admissible heuristic; almost all admissible heuristics will be
            consistent as well.

            If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse uniform cost search finds,
            your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!  On the
            other hand, inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal
            solutions, so be careful.

            The state is a tuple ( pacmanPosition, foodGrid ) where foodGrid is a Grid
            (see game.py) of either True or False. You can call foodGrid.asList() to get
            a list of food coordinates instead.

            If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the
            problem.  For example, problem.walls gives you a Grid of where the walls
            are.

            If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the
            heuristic, there is a dictionary called problem.heuristicInfo that you can
            use. For example, if you only want to count the walls once and store that
            value, try: problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount'] = problem.walls.count()
            Subsequent calls to this heuristic can access
            problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount']
